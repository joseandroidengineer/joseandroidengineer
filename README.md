## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jose, a Mobile Developer. I've been in the software development industry for about 9 years already and I graduated from college in 2014.
My whole experience has been nothing but Android Development and I love it. Looking forward to continue building cool stuff and work on other projects 
besides my own.
